# work-day-scheduler

## Description

This is a calendar application where the user can save events for each working hour of the day. This data is storted within localStorage and persits between browser sessions. For each time block, these are shown in different colours to represent if it is a past, current, or future hour of the day.

Dates are handled with Moment JS, and the application features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Usage

After entering the text for the specific time block, the save button for that event can be clicked to save this to local storage.
